The custom symbolic representations for each action in our study are in the following files in the ./png subfolder, 
Test_Rep1.txt - Action 1
Test_Rep2.txt - Action 2
Test_Rep3.txt - Action 3
Test_Rep4.txt - Action 4
Test_Rep5.txt - Action 5

To see the outputs of the network for each of these actions run the following command from the root folder, 
python sample_v7.py --Testing_flag True --Test_file './png/file_name' 

with the name of the file you want to use as the input.
